```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

## Problem 1

I first downloaded a package containing the penguins dataset by running code directly in the console.

Next, I am loading the moderndive library and loading the early_january_weather dataset

```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

Next, I skim data for summary of dataset

```{r}
skimr::skim(early_january_weather)
```

* There are 15 variables in this dataset. Names of important variables include temp, dep, humid, wind_dir, wind_Speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib. 
* There are `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.
* The mean temperature is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.
